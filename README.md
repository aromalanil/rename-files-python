# 📜Rename files python
A simple python script to remove a certain keyword from all files in a directory.

## Why ❓

I was annoyed by the "tamilrockers" prefix in the filename of my movie collection. Renaming each file in the folder would be 😤. So created this simple python script.

## How 🤨

1. Copy and paste the ``rename.py`` file into the directory
2. Open the terminal in the directory
3. Run ``python rename.py``
4. Enter the keyword you want to remove

## ⚠️ Warning

* Do not rename system files with this.
* Use this carefully, Don't accidentally rename important files.
